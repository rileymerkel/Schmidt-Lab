Custom R script to process behavior evoked changes in fluorescence using fiber photometry in freely moving animals. 

Raw signal (465 nm) and isosbestic control (405 nm) channel data and behavioral data were exported from Synapse to a CSV file using a MATLAB script provided by Tucker Davis Technology, then imported into R.
